<p>I come from a <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">technical</a> background with experience in <a href="http://www.sopogy.com/" target="_blank">cleantech</a>, <a href="http://www.ge-energy.com/" target="_blank">M&amp;A</a>, and even the <a href="http://www.afweather.af.mil/" target="_blank">weather</a> &#8212; but I&#8217;m not a social worker or gerontologist. Besides repeatedly chasing down my escaped beagle at an assisted living facility down the block, I hadn’t given much thought to senior care or senior housing. So it’s justified when people ask why I changed careers and am dedicating myself to it.</p>
<p>My Savta is in a &#8220;senior&#8221; community in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaO3A-m13Q" target="_blank">Southern Florida</a>, where all good Jews move once NY gets too cold (wasn&#8217;t it always this cold?). My other Nona had Alzheimer&#8217;s and eventually required 24/7 care by an unimaginably patient and giving Filipino caretaker. (Anecdotally, I&#8217;ve only heard fantastic stories about Filipino caregivers.) Unfortunately both my grandfathers died from heart attacks, and both at young ages. Women make up the <a href="http://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/il/fs77r_ltc.pdf" target="_blank">vast majority</a> of residents in nursing homes as most of their husbands pass away first.</p>
<p>The experiences with my grandparents was the genesis of my exploration about how it will be if/when my mother needs long-term care. My mother was really the first to introduce me to the industry several years ago as an interior designer (<a href="http://pvzdesign.com/" target="_blank">PVZ Design</a>) specializing on &#8220;aging in place.&#8221; The more I dug, the more I realized what an immensehole is approaching. Everyone knows the <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/1/pop/p25-1129.pdf" target="_blank">demographic stories</a> &#8212; we&#8217;re getting older (because of the baby boomer bump coupled with increased lifespan) and having less children. There are lots of pretty graphics and editorials on this topic but, <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/04/29/151646558/if-a-fact-dies-in-the-forest-will-anyone-believe-it" target="_blank">so long as facts haven’t died</a>, this is as factual and irrefutable as it gets.</p>
<p>The hole in our sights is that this mass of our population will require more care than is available today, and more than is projected to be available tomorrow. As with (almost) all other disciplines, it boils down to economics and the effect of those economics on people. A <a href="http://works.bepress.com/darius_lakdawalla/17/" target="_blank">key research report</a> out of the RAND Corporation concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>The growth in long-term care utilization we predict in this paper is quite substantial. The nursing home population is likely to grow by 10-25% more than current trends in disability would predict. This will have impacts on statewide Medicaid systems and the economy at large. Indeed, this might even be a rosy scenario, because we have not considered the response of long-term care prices. Another possibility is that the price of nursing home care will rise sharply and Medicaid eligibility will contract to limit growth in nursing home residence. In this case, <em>the greatest costs will be borne not by state governments, but by sick and disabled individuals who may be unable to afford the high price of nursing home care</em>. [emphasis added]</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There are lots of great industries with aspects of altruism to dedicate yourself to. I’m still an extremely strong supporter of cleantech (and advise on the side). Then there’s the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/11/egypt-facebook-revolution-wael-ghonim_n_822078.html" target="_blank">Facebook Revolution</a> in Egypt and and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009%E2%80%932010_Iranian_election_protests" target="_blank">Twitter Revolution</a> in Iran. And who doesn’t love a veteran? But as un-vogue as it might seem to my friends, senior care is where I’m focused.</p>
