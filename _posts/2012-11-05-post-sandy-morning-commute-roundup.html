<p>1. Train is about 10 minutes late. Not bad. Freezing. <br/>2. Got a seat! Good start! <br/>3. Switch trains in Newark. Mass confusion with thousands of people. All terminal signs are broken. People not happy and lots of police. <br/>4. Announcement: Train&#8217;s not coming. Sad people. <br/>5. Announcement: Train&#8217;s coming. Happy people. More pushing. <br/>6. Train&#8217;s here! But it&#8217;s full, sorry. Squish in side. Squish more! Most people don&#8217;t make it on. Zero seats but I have about 1/2 sq ft to my name. Success!  <br/>7. Train&#8217;s moving, almost there!  <br/>8. We&#8217;re stopped. <br/>9. We&#8217;re stopped some more.  <br/>10. Announcement: We&#8217;ll be here for awhile. <br/>11. We&#8217;re stopped. <br/>12. We&#8217;re stopped some more. <br/>&#8230;. <br/>20. We&#8217;re stopped. <br/>21. We&#8217;re moving slowly! <br/>22. Made it to Penn Station! <br/>23. Mad dash and push off the train. Wait, why are all the escalators flowing the wrong direction? We&#8217;re stuck down here. <br/>24. Run to escalator. Push emergency stop button. Policeman raps  his baton on the window. Policeman runs, I run. We&#8217;re both running. He&#8217;s fat, and I got my Puma&#8217;s on. <br/>25. I&#8217;m out! Free! <br/>26. Resolve to work from home until all trains are working properly. </p>
