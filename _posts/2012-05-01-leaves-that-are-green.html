<p><span>As with many others, music has always been able to take me away to a special place. Away from the puddly sidewalks and sharp elbows of 7th Ave and back to wherever I want to be. It&#8217;s good to disconnect.</span></p>
<p><span>Occasionally I forget to put on my headphones and then suddenly find myself wondering why this commute is <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/seder.htm" target="_blank">different </a>than all the other commutes. Why is it taking so long and then the invariable mind race to figure out how to eliminate the commute. Pop the headphones in and my eyes open and smile emerges. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>I was twenty-one years when I wrote this song / I&#8217;m twenty-two now but I won&#8217;t be for long / Time hurries on. / And the leaves that are green turn to brown, / And they wither with the wind, / And they crumble in your hand.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>When I was young I had a Sony Walkman tape player and would make mix tapes. We’d record from the radio and argue about the legalities &#8212; we couldn’t imagine the days of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster" target="_blank">Napster</a>, and now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_(protocol)" target="_blank">BitTorrent</a>. One special Chanukah my parents bought my sister and I a boombox with a built-in CD player. We didn’t have a single CD but soon after, I waited on the long line at the Paramus Tower Records for the Guns N’ Roses<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Use-Your-Illusion-Guns-Roses/dp/B000000OSE" target="_blank">Use Your Illusion</a> CD set. What a great album to break your CD cherry on.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Once my heart was filled with the love of a girl. / held her close, but she faded in the night / Like a poem I meant to write. / And the leaves that are green turn to brown, / And they wither with the wind, / And they crumble in your hand.</span></p>

<p><span>In the post MP3 but pre-iPod days I experimented to dozens of players. Sony Ericsson’s cell-phone / Walkman was a bust. I was always surprised how terrible SE’s handsets were. One summer back in Israel my cousin picked up my cell phone and exclaimed about its weight, “?מה, אתה בעונש” (“what, are you being punished?”) Partnering with Sony <a href="http://crave.cnet.co.uk/mobiles/how-did-sony-ericsson-lose-200m-and-can-sony-do-better-50006711/" target="_blank">didn’t help much</a>.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>I threw a pebble in a brook / And watched the ripples run away / And they never made a sound. / And the leaves that are green turned to brown, / And they wither with the wind, / And they crumble in your hand.</span></p>

<p><span>I was a big Led Zepplin and Pink Floyd fan in primary school. Another cousin of mine in Israel had a wall mural of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44743850@N00/232800693/" target="_blank">The Wall</a>. He kept his Army M-16 under his bed and let me fumble with it while complaining about having to go back to Gaza the next day. He wasn’t excited by the rocks and really didn’t like the bottles. That was way before <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%27s_unilateral_disengagement_plan" target="_blank">the withdrawal</a> when there were still nice greenhouses. We traded in rocks and bottles and tomatoes for Katyushas. But then Broza told us <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPvsIkWc1nE&amp;feature=results_main&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL7BE80C55B7EEE845" target="_blank">it will be good</a>, and so it will. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, / Good-bye, Good-bye, Good-bye, Good-bye, / That&#8217;s all there is. / And the leaves that are green turned to brown.</span></p>

<p><span>The best noise-cancelling over-the-ear headphone does not compare to live music. I had the privilege of living in New Orleans pre-K and honor of leading relief efforts there post-K, and there’s no comparison. Horns emanate almost everywhere you go. Music is core to life in New Orleans and it’s all-accepting. The music cannot be denied to anyone &#8212; it’s a great equalizer and the ultimate meritocracy. Musicians are a dime a dozen and at the same moment celebrities and neighbors. <a href="http://www.american.com/archive/2007/march-april-magazine-contents/new-orleans-mon-amour/" target="_blank">Kermit </a>orders his drink right next to you at the Maple Leaf.</span></p>
<p><span>But absent a jam session at Union Square I’ll never leave home without my headphones. </span></p>
