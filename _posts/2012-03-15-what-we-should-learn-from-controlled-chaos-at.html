<p>We were lucky enough to get a personal tour of <a href="http://www.gramercytavern.com/" target="_blank">Gramercy Tavern</a>‘s caverns, and they are ridiculously busy. The top photo is in the “basement” kitchen where an armada of doctors are prepping flocks of ducks and herds of cows (Wed is protein day). Chef Michael Anthony is showing our friend <a href="http://chefchai.com/" target="_blank">Chef Chai</a> the inside of his freezer (It must have been impressive to a fellow chef). Chai was in NYC as a featured chef for the <a href="http://www.jamesbeard.org/" target="_blank">James Beard Foundation</a> and I recommend checking out his restaurant next time you’re in Honolulu, <a href="http://www.chaisislandbistro.com/" target="_blank">Chai’s Island Bistro</a>.</p>
<p><span> </span>There are two floors of kitchens, including a bakery and what looked like an internal florist. Dozens of workers whiz  over slippery floors witch determined efficiency, and they all seemed remarkably happy (as compared to the kitchen of a take-out Chinese restaurant). Great lesson in controlled chaos and I presume Chef Anthony is a great leader to keep them all going.</p>
