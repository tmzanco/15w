<p><span>I wanted to try out </span><a href="http://www.warbyparker.com/" target="_blank">Warby Parker</a><span>  since last year when I first heard about the $95 glasses (with prescription!). For the well-sighted among us, $95 is a steal for prescription glasses. Optometrists are known for having huge markups and there are plenty of middle-men to take extra cuts. We had a friend in Hawaii who has a  grand ‘ol life by selling molded Chinese plastic to the local optometrists. And if you visit </span><a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g297418-i10040-k1518510-Gongbei_underground_mall-Zhuhai_Guangdong.html" target="_blank">Gongbei Underground Market</a><span> in </span><a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Zhuhai#b" target="_blank">Zhuhai</a><span>, China, you’ll see plenty of designer glasses perched next to LED flashlights and </span><a href="http://www.lvmh.com/" target="_blank">LVMH</a><span> bags.</span></p>
<p>Warby Parker sends you five frames of your choosing via their <a href="http://www.warbyparker.com/Home-Try-On" target="_blank">home try-on</a> program. All this for free, except to us in Hawaii and I wasn’t interested in the round-trip shipping charges. The Warby brand is hipster. Cool. Very retro-modern. I could see myself with a scraggly beard and hipster flannel sporting the Warby’s and trotting down Chelsea. They’re a bit thicker than the rimless varieties I’m fond of but maybe it’s time for a change.</p>
<p>So to avoid the oceanic shipping charges I relocated the family away from <a href="http://www.khon2.com/news/local/story/Record-sized-hail-pounds-windward-Oahu/EeuTUFC8iUiYn_JH-6LU3A.cspx" target="_blank">paradise</a> and back to the <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111581066" target="_blank">Garden State</a>. I began planning for which five glasses I’d choose in my kit. WP has a few dozen choices for men but they all seem pretty similar — thick with lenses a bit bigger than they should be. My 1970′s dad would have loved them. I used the “virtual try-on” function and narrowed it down to five that I actually thought looked pretty good.</p>
<p>The kit was plopped on my doorstep within two days and I set to finding the best one. At first I thought WP screwed up and sent me five of the same frames, but in slightly different hues. They look remarkably similar but once trying them on you can see the difference.</p>
<p>My wife’s reaction was pretty spot-on — no winners in that lot. To be fair, I have a hard time finding frames that work well  but, also to be fair, I’m not sure who these frames will really work on. That also said, WP’s glasses are well-made and nicely designed, just not for me. I’ll stick to the close-to-free glasses at <a href="http://www.coastal.com/?ilid=tnav" target="_blank">Coastal</a> or the overpriced ones at the doc. So I tried them on my daughter where almost everything works (except listening). She loved them and wore them all morning until the coffee wore off.</p>
