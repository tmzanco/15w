<p>This winter has been tough. It feels much worse than normal but my gauge is off after living in Hawaii for nine years. So what does the data show? I downloaded a few climatological data sets from the <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search?datasetid=GHCND" target="_blank">National Climatic Data Center</a>. NCDC, part of NOAA, has some fantastic resources and with a bit of excel and Tableau trickery I had all the snowfall totals since 1936 for Newark Airport in New Jersey (a good proxy for the NYC area but less so for Long Island). </p>
<p>The Air Force&#8217;s <a href="http://www.afweather.af.mil/units/airforceweatheragency/14thweathersquadron.asp" target="_blank">14th Weather Squadron</a> has better climatological databases, but I couldn&#8217;t publish them here and these are good enough. I also downloaded all the snow fall totals from <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KEWR/1948/1/1/DailyHistory.html?req_city=NA&amp;req_state=NA&amp;req_statename=NA" target="_blank">Wunderground&#8217;s daily history</a> and discovered that even though their site shows data, they don&#8217;t have any for anything before 2006 (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/4clvD2M.png" target="_blank">see here</a>).</p>
<p>It turns out that the numbers agree that this winter sucks. In the last 78 years only five years had more snowfall up to 7 Feb 2014. With the today’s snowstorm we’re likely to pop into fourth place, out seating the great winter of 1948. I still remember the 1996 season (3rd worst since 1948) and the week we had off from high school. </p>
<p>Precariously projecting future snowfall based on past snowfall (which has a terrible correlation but is fun to think about) predicts that 2014 will have over 4.5 feet of snow (55”). </p>
<p>With 42” booked to date, we can pretend to expect another 13” to close out the season. Let’s hope they all fall today.</p>
