<p>We&#8217;ve been on the hunt for exceptional talent since even before launching <a href="http://www.silverliving.com" target="_blank">Silver Living</a>. We need highly technical engineers that are an awesome fit with the rest of the team. And we need kick-butt photographers to work remotely and who love to take photos in low-light. We’ve been very fortunate to have great interest for these positions and have seen lots of prospects.</p>
<p>Lots of prospects means lots of resumes, and they range from succinct and useful to just plain terrible. The objective of this post is more about what you should do rather than what not to do, but I still need to highlight some pitfalls. These might seem (painfully) obvious but they’re real-world examples.</p>
<ol><li><span>Cropped PDFs - Never send a pdf with the edges cropped to where you cannot read the end-of-line text. </span><span>Especially if you’re applying as a graphic designer.</span></li>
<li><span>Text bombs - Easy on the long-narratives. More show, less tell. TL; DR.</span></li>
<li><span>Readability - See example below. Arrows indicate text direction. Don’t expect reader to turn the monitor. (Note: the image was hosted on Posterous, which is no longer with the living. I didn't have time to dig it up and repost here. Picture a resume with a large arrow on it.)</span></li>

<p>How companies hire is <a href="http://42floors.com/blog/posts/consider-this-a-job-offer-to-work-at-42floors" target="_blank">radically</a> changing. The supply / demand balance on many skill sets is way off. Resumes just aren’t that useful for these positions. Most people prefer to see what someone’s done rather than read about it. Show us the <a href="http://www.behance.net/" target="_blank">designs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">code</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/" target="_blank">pictures</a>, <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/palettes" target="_blank">compositions</a>, applications. Show me how you grew into your latest mindset. What pet projects do you have that relate to these skills &#8212; or, even better, what passion projects?</p>
