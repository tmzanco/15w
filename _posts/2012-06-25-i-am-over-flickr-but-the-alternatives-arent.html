<p>I took my first digital picture in 1997 with a rented camera at the <a href="http://illinois.edu/" target="_blank">University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign</a>. And instantly I was hooked.</p>

<p>It was a Kodak <a href="http://downloads.fotosource.com/public/camera_manuals/Kodak/DigitalCameras/DC120.pdf" target="_blank">DC120</a> <a href="http://photo.net/equipment/kodak/dc120" target="_blank">touted </a>as “a cheap megapixel digital camera. 1000x1000 pixels for under $1000.” (although it wasn’t a true megapixel camera since the sensor resolution was less than 1MP.) The very first picture:</p>

<p>Ever since then I’ve been snapping away with dozens of increasingly better cameras. I am the definition of an amateur photographer but I take lots of pictures. Lots.</p>
<p><span>Each picture on the DC120 was 50kB. Now I mostly use my iPhone 4 and a Nikon D5000, a Costco special, and file sizes are between 2MB - 6MB. Multiply that by lots of pictures over 15 years and I need lots of space to store it. The story of how I learned the importance of album back-ups the hard way follows &#8212; skip down to the table if you want to just see the Flickr alternatives.</span></p>
<p><span>By 2002 I had the foundation of a huge a family portfolio. I just moved to Hawaii and settled into a great house in </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiea,_Hawaii" target="_blank"><span>Aiea Heights</span></a><span> overlooking </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor" target="_blank"><span>Pearl Harbor</span></a><span>. It seemed like a nice neighborhood but within a week of the movers delivering my boxes of crap, they came back and stole it all. </span><span>I didn’t care about much of it except for my camera, laptop, and PDA (yes I had one in 2002). This was pre-ultra-cheap external hard drives and all my photos were on my laptop. Bailey, the beagle, was still in </span><a href="http://hawaii.gov/hdoa/ai/aqs/info" target="_blank"><span>quarantine</span></a><span> but I think they could have just rubbed his ears for a moment and he would have acquiesced. After lots of cussing and incredulity towards the less-than-helpful </span><a href="http://www.honolulupd.org/" target="_blank"><span>HPD</span></a><span>, I called every pawn store in town and found my laptop at </span><a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=pawn&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=21.285006,-157.81354&amp;spn=0.002924,0.004823&amp;sll=21.280757,-157.814291&amp;sspn=0.002924,0.004823&amp;gl=us&amp;t=m&amp;radius=0.19&amp;hq=pawn&amp;z=18&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=21.284918,-157.813556&amp;panoid=mSkE0ojP0Wn8ofO9CiAZXQ&amp;cbp=12,290.38,,1,7.23" target="_blank"><span>one across town</span></a><span>. The theif had to present his ID and </span><span>a thumb print</span><span> but HPD still didn’t prosecute. This was my first lesson in how things work on the </span><a href="http://www.aloha-hawaii.com/hawaii/language/" target="_blank"><span>aina</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>The next day I signed up for an online photo sharing/storing site. I can’t even remember which one it was but I quickly switched to </span><a href="http://www.fotki.com/" target="_blank"><span>fotki</span></a><span>. Back then, fotki looked more or else identically to how it looks today. But that was pre-web 2.0 and it was ok. It was cheap and fit the bill of unlimited storage. Over the years I added gigs and gigs of pictures. My parents and sister joined the party and added their own pictures and the pixels went forth multiplied.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/" target="_blank"><span>Flickr</span></a><span> wasn’t launched until 2004. After admiring their design and community I finally bit the switching-cost bullet in 2010. Fotki made it too easy to ftp in and download all original photos and folders intact. I uploaded to Flickr and we were set.</span></p>
<p><span><em>But my parents and sister hated flickr from the beginning.</em></span></p>
<p><span>They didn’t understand the difference between collections and galleries. They didn’t get how you can upload a photo to flickr and it not be in a set. It’s somewhere in the ether. My mom uploaded thousands of photos into the ether. My flickr ether is a mess. And periodically I re-explain the uploading process but it never sticks.</span></p>
<p><span>And flickr stagnated over the years as Yahoo sucked the life out of it.</span></p>
<p><span>So I’m ready for a change. Or so I thought. I researched all the alternatives I could find and compared them in the chart below. It’s a bit of an eyesore but the bottom line is that there still aren’t materially better alternative. Sure there are better ones, but there are no ideal choices. No one’s eating their cake here.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>I analyzed the alternatives based on what I need for dual purpose of family sharing and the all-important off-site backup: </span><br/></strong></p>
<ul><li><span>Folders/Sub-Folder: Flickr didn’t have “sub-folders” (called galleries) until years after they launched. I can’t have all 15 years worth of albums in the root level.</span></li>
<li><span>Unlimited Space: I need lots of space.</span></li>
<li><span>Export Ease: I’m fickle and want to be able to get my photos back when I want them. Flickr is </span><span>terrible</span><span> at this but <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/08/i-wont-use-flickr-until-they-release-my-photo-hostages/" target="_blank">I can’t blame them</a> &#8212; it keeps all of us locked in.</span></li>
<li><span>Videos: These are new over the last five years but not essential.</span></li>
<li><span>Aesthetic: Shitty design sucks.</span></li>
<li><span>Price: I’m a cheap skate.</span></li>
</ul><p>Disclaimer: I did not sign-up for all these products so much of this analysis is from the outside in. Export ease was particularly hard to predict. It may be wrong &#8212; if you know better, just let me know and I can make a note.</p>
<p>I created this for my own decision tree but hope this helps you choose the appropriate service for your needs. I’m also curious to know if I missed any stellar service that I should consider &#8212; please do let me know.<br><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9147goCEW1r9hi7u.png"/></p>
