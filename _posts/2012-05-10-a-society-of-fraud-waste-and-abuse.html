<p><span><span><span>Today my good friend sent me </span><span>a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/new-government-reports-confirm-that-tsa-nude-body-scanners-are-wasteful-and-ineffective-2012-5" target="_blank">BI article</a> detailing how useless the airport body scanners are. How much money’s been wasted on them. How much money will continue to be wasted on them. His note was “perfect for you.” Only it’s not.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Every time I read these stories it’s like a punch in the gut. In this case, a failed acquisitions program manned by some guy at </span><a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xopnbiz/regulations/" target="_blank"><span>DHS</span></a><span> who thought this would be cool toy. Sure it involved more than that but how hard is it to do the cost-benefit on these things? Don’t they have napkins to scribble on? This might not constitute Fraud, Waste, and Abuse in the </span><a href="http://www.gao.gov/fraudnet/fraudnet.htm" target="_blank"><span>official</span></a><span>sense but it certainly is a huge waste in common sense.</span></p>
<p><span>Witnessing FW&amp;A first hand is a common occurrence in the government. When I was in the Air Force we all had our funny FW&amp;A stories which usually went like this:</span></p>
<ul><li>Remember when 20 flat-screen TVs showed up at our office and we didn’t even have enough wall space for them? Yea, I think there are still four new ones in the closet.</li>
<li>We’re not allowed to have a conference but if we just call it a training session then the unit will pay for the coffees &amp; snacks. We can’t pay for breakfast this way so we’ll just call it lunch, and then have two lunches. </li>
<li>Whoa, why did you buy $1000 worth of paper and pens? It will take us 5 years to use this all up. Answer: Oh, I had to burn the rest of our budget on something and I can use the p-card at Office Depot. I also ordered four printers. </li>
<li>Where’d you get that air-conditioned trailer? Answer: HQ bought it once we told them that they can use it when they visit us in the field. </li>
</ul><p><span>These are true stories. But they’re not necessarily against the rules. Multiply these by the entire federal government and you end up with stories like the full-body scanners. Or enterprise computer systems deployed in 2012 but based on Windows XP.</span></p>
<p><span>Units routinely place “unfunded requests,” like the 20 TVs, on the chance that at the end of the year there will be some money “left over” that must be spent. It goes to the unfunded list. Why not save it for next year? Terrible truth is that the unit cannot save the money, it flows back to the ether and when the powers that be allocate a new budget they see that you had leftover money &#8212; so they give you less next time. You’re penalized for saving money. (slight nuance: the TVs were paid for with Global War on Terror dollars. Give us 20 TVs and we’ll find Osama and the weapons of mass destruction &#8212; how can you deny that?)</span></p>
<p><span>I’d argue any day that the integrity level in the military is much higher than in the rest of the government. Sure we have lunatics and thieves and murderers, but at a lower rate than the general population. The failure is that most people don’t think of these stories as FW&amp;A because they’re allowed by leadership and just so-damn-prevalent.</span></p>
<p><span>In some of the extreme instances (back to the airports) you get political meddling. Kip Hawley recently wrote a </span><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303815404577335783535660546.html" target="_blank"><span>piece in the NYTimes</span></a><span> in essence saying: I tried fixing it but I was powerless against the outside interests, including politicians. The head of the TSA couldn’t even stop his blue-shirted army from making us take our shoes off. </span><br/><span>The common argument I get is that any savings is just a drop in the bucket. It’s a ludicrous argument because the savings is measured in real dollars, not as a percentage of the total budget. But that leads to a bigger problem: what do you do with the savings? In the military there’s a concept of “the color of money”. Is it meant for O&amp;M? For construction? For travel? Shift from one bucket to another and you’re on a short road to a brain damaging process. Save it for another year and you’re penalized on your next budget. No wonder the term</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Catch-22-Joseph-Heller/dp/0684833395" target="_blank"><span>Catch-22</span></a><span> caught on.</span></p>
<p><span>We’re structurally inefficient. At our core. The entire apparatus must be replaced to make any change. Long-term incentives (don’t think executive comp and Lehman Bros) for the decision makers. Encourage savings. Dictating arbitrary 10% budget cuts gets far less bang for the buck.</span></p>
<p><span>This is all common sense to anyone who’s worked in the private sector, but that’s not to say it’s non-existent. In the startup world you’re given more responsibility than you would be at a larger company. Buying equipment, services, sundries is not limited to the office administrator. I’ve seen misallocation of resources at startups, simply because their interests aren’t aligned. A hire who’s in it for the short term, coupled with immaturity, will quickly go astray. In the early days (typically read: years) all employees should be partners. Partners with aligned interest in the combined success. How we achieve partnership is up to each of us differently &#8212; it’s a bond between the team individually and the common goal.</span></p>
<p><span>Unit cohesiveness in the military is a common term but military cohesiveness is not. Government cohesiveness is not. Country cohesiveness is not. When you get to that level our individual desires outweigh the then-diluted common goal. And when that happens you get full-body scanners that aren&#8217;t actually effective.</span></p>
