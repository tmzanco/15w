I am Tal Ziv, a proud Aba to three maniacs and an angel.

I grew up in [Israel](https://www.airbnb.com/s/Rehovot--Israel), [NY](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Plainview,+NY/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c281e6e8447209:0xacb02419b8d9625e?sa=X&ei=nn6EVIjVEoqSsQS7_YCgCg&ved=0CIIBEPIBMAs), and [NJ](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ridgewood,+NJ/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c2e4a543a88c39:0x7185a0a5d2697b0?sa=X&ei=t36EVP-_BIu_sQSLo4LwCg&ved=0CIkBEPIBMAs). I studied at the [Technion](http://www.technion.ac.il/en/) (briefly), [UIUC](http://www.ece.illinois.edu/) (for a year), [Cornell](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/) (BS Computer Science), [Texas A&M](http://atmo.tamu.edu/) (Meteorology in the Air Force), and the [Shidler College of Business](http://shidler.hawaii.edu/) (MBA in international business). I taught at the [Stanford Graduate School of Business](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/).

I lead partnerships for [Nike Innovation](https://news.nike.com/innovation) and love it. My career has spanned Air Force [weather forecasting systems](https://www.airforce.com/careers/detail/weather-officer), [renewable](https://www.gepower.com/) [energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sopogy) and [venture capital](http://enerdigm.com/portfolio/), [conglomerates that shouldn't be conglomerates](http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2012/06/29/matson-split-from-alexander-baldwin.html), and several startups in the [consumer web](https://pando.com/2012/11/27/backed-by-500-startups-silver-living-offers-honest-reviews-of-senior-communities/), blockchain, and bitcoin.


15W is the [Air Force specialty code](http://usmilitary.about.com/library/milinfo/afoffjobs/bl15wx.htm) for weather officer.
