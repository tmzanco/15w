<p class="MsoNormal"><span>If someone would have told me a week ago that we&#8217;d have to push our launch date by two weeks, I&#8217;d have thought it might be from plenty of reasons, such as a hard-won partner getting cold feet. Or a complete loss of our code, although my co-founder would likely choke at just slipping two weeks. I wouldn&#8217;t have thought the slippage might be from a <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/scenes-from-hurricane-sandy.html" target="_blank">silly low pressure system</a> that should have been terrorizing blue haired ladies in Boca (and I&#8217;m an Air Force meteorologist).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>If someone would have told me a year ago that I&#8217;d sell my house in Hawaii, move to NJ, and buy a moped, I&#8217;d have thought I must have gotten a divorce. I mean, NJ? A moped?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>With the future omnisciently known, it&#8217;s damn hard to guess the course that brought you there. And in the roughest of courses it&#8217;s hard to be the trite water flowing through the brook. Some part of you is always smashing into a rock or flipping upside down. It&#8217;s turbulent and never calm in all places. But it all flows as one, smoothly.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>My co-founder Mike and I set out nearly nine months ago on our own brook. Our goal was simple: to make it easier to find and research senior living options. We set out to make a new class of research tools and for the first time ever provide an unbiased view on different senior living communities. It might sound pedantic if you&#8217;ve never had to find care for your parent. You might expect there to be a <a href="http://www.oyster.com/" target="_blank">Zagat-like</a> service with expert reviews, or at the very least a TripAdvisor-like service with family reviews of these communities. We had the same incorrect expectations.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Our brook was rocky and turbulent, although in retrospect no more than any of yours. At times uncomfortably wide and at others equivalently narrow and fast. We hung on through plenty of internal rocks (read: f-ups), and our fair share of external ones, Hurricane Sandy taking the lox. Just two weeks ago our lead photographer was burgled and lost all her camera gear, and week of scheduled shoots. In September our mystery shopper had a death in the family. Our first NYC office didn&#8217;t believe in notification and decided to refinish the floors while we worked. Every day we&#8217;d come in and find our desk in a different place and caked with dust.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>What seem like large boulders in front of you become nothing but a hump in the flow of the rearview. I&#8217;m typing this on my laptop, in the dark, on an air mattress, in my sister&#8217;s basement, with borrowed power from a Panera Bread an hour south of here. We&#8217;re sick of Wegman&#8217;s rotisserie chickens, waiting on gasoline lines, and smelling like gasoline. But all this will be a hump in the flow of the rearview in only <a href="http://www.pseg.com/info/media/newsreleases/2012/2012-11-02a.jsp" target="_blank">7-10 more days</a>.</span></p>
